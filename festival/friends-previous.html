How you all doin'?
<br>
This is Irvine Kinneas.
<br>
Selphie asked if I would write something. How could I refuse?
<br><br>
Well, I'm here from Galbadia Garden due to personal reasons. I think I fit in quite well. What do you all think? With so many cuties here, I look forward to gettin' up in the mornings.

Yo, s'up? It's Zell Dincht.
<br>
...The hell do I write?
<br>
Yeah, I know. I said I'd write somethin' but I have nothin' to write.
<br>
Oh wait...I-love-hot dogs. You know, the ones that're always sold out?
<br>
Anyway, that's it for me!

Hello, this is Quistis Trepe.
<br>
I've been quite busy with my SeeD duties. How's everyone doing with their studies and training? For all those working towards becoming a SeeD and everyone else, just remember, have fun.
<br><br>
Why do I always end up sounding like an instructor?
<br>
...Perhaps I am a little too...serious?
<br><br>
