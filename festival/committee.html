Hi! My name is Selphie Tilmitt! I just transferred here from Trabia Garden. I was on the Garden Festival Committee there, so I'm excited to join... But...there's no one on the committee here. So I guess that makes me the chair! As the Garden Festival chair, I plan to make full use of this page.
<br><br>
So, here we go!
Who wants to be on the Garden Festival Committee? C'mon everyone, join! Let's all work together make the Garden Festival a success! (Personally I want to have a concert! What do you all think?)
<br>

I guess it wasn't meant to be, this time, but there'll be a Garden Festival next year, and the year after that and on and on! So... We're still looking for new members!
(It's not like I've given up on this one yet!)<br>
