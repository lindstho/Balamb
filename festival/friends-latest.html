Hi, my name is Rinoa. I'm not a student at Garden, but I'll be staying here for a while. I really like it here.
<br><br>
Um...there's something I wanted to say. When you make friends, it'd be nice to be able to finish growing up together, without having to think we'll be separated. Even if we do grow up apart, I want to be able to meet up and talk with a smile.
Hmm? What am I trying to say?
<br><br>
Anyway, I don't think I've ever been in a setting with so many people about my age. It's kinda like camp. It's fun! I'm really glad I'm here.
