I've come up with a new bulletin board! But I don't know what it'll be about. I was thinkin' something along the lines of friends, but I don't really have any friends at this Garden yet. This is a great chance for me to make friends! And then we'll work together to make the Garden Festival a reality!

I made a friend! I think I'll have my friends write stuff directly in here. I thought I'd have our leader, Squall go first, but then I realized he'd never do that... So here's the order...
<br>
<a href="friends-latest.html">Look up latest entry.</a>
<br>
<a href="friends-previous.html">Look up previous entries.</a><br>
<a href="index.html" target="_top">&#9670; Back</a>
